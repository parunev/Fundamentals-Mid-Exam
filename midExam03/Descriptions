1. Counter Strike

Write a program that keeps track on every won battle against enemy. You will recieve inital energy. Afterward you will start recieving the distance you 
need to reach an enemy. You either recieve "End of Battle" or you run out of energy.
The energy you need to for reaching an enemy is equal to the distance you recieve. For each time you reach enemy you win and your energy is reduced. 
Every third won battle increase your energy with value of your current won battles.
If you run out of energy - end program.


2. Shoot for the win

Write a program that helps you keep track of your shot targets. 
You receive a sequence with integers, separated by space, representing targets and their value.
After that you recieve indices until command "End" and you need to print the targets and count of shot targets.
Everytime you recieve index you need to shoot the target on that index, if it's possible.

Everytime you shoot a target, its value becomes -1 and it's considered shot.
Also with that you need to reduce all other targets, which have greater values than your current target, with it's value.
Also with that you need to increase all the other targets, which have less or equal value to the shot target, with it's value.
You can't shoot a target which is already shot and you can't increase or reduce target which is considered shot.


3. Moving target

Write a program that helps you keep track of moving targets.
You recieve a sequence of targets with their integer values, split by a single space.
Then you will recieve commands for manipulating the targets until command "End". shoot, add, strike, end
