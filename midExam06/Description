1. Black Flag

Create a program that checks if the target plunder is reached.
You will recieve how many days the pirating lasts, how much pirates plunder fo a day, expected plunder.

Write a program to calculate how much plunder the pirates manages to gather. 
Each day they gather the plunder, every third day they attack more ships and add additional plunder to their gain - 50% of daily plunder.
Every fifth day the pirates encounter a warship and after the battle they lose 30% of their total plunder.


2. Treasure Hunt

Create a program that manages the state of the treasure chest along the way.
You recieve a input with initial loot.

After that you will recieve several commands until "Yohoho!"
Loot - pick up treasure loot along the way. Insert them at the beginning of the chest. if item already contained, skip. 
Drop - index - remove the loot at the given index and add it at the end of the chest. if the index is invalid, skip.
Steal - count - someone steal the last count loot items. If there are fewer items than the given count, remove as much as there are.

In the end we print average treasure gain, which is the sum of all treasure items length divided by the count of all items inside the chest.
